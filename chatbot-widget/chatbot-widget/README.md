# Chatbot Widget

This project provides a simple chatbot widget that can be embedded into any webpage. The widget consists of a button that, when clicked, opens a full-height div for user interaction.

## Project Structure

- **src/styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the button and the full-height div, ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **src/index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the button and links to the JavaScript and CSS files. This file serves as the entry point for embedding the widget.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts (if any).

## How to Embed the Widget
